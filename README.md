# Random-password
This is a python based with which you can create a program that accepts the user's input and produces a random password based on those words. The password is easily remembered by the user by using the words he entered as input.

In this code we are using mainly three main modules which include string.ascii_letters,string.digits,string.punctuation 
We are using random library:
random – The python random module helps a user to generate pseudo-random numbers. Inside the module, there are various functions that just depend on the function “random()”. This function generates a random float uniformly in the semi-open range [0.0, 1.0) i.e. it generates a decimal number greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than one. 

Code Implementation:
First, take the length of the password as input. Then we can display a prompt about the possible list of characters that a user wants to include in the password –
-For including letters in the character set append string.ascii_letters in the character list.
-For including letters in the character set append string.digits in the character list.
-For including letters in character set append string.punctuation in the character list
